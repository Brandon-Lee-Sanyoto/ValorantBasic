        <p>Valorant takes the best from similar games in the genre. Pairing ability based heroes with a vault of weaponry enables the game to play in a hypercompetitive fashion. This 5 versus 5 multiplayer shooter is closest to Counter-Strike: Source in terms of gameplay with the added bonus of characters with unique abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are two sides in the game – Attackers and Defenders. The Attackers’ job is to push a site where their objective is to plant the “Spike”. Like other “search and destroy” style shooters, if the Spike detonates, the attackers win the round. Their opponents – the Defenders – must stop the enemy team from planting the Spike at all costs.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="Assets/" alt="">
        <p>To win a round, teams must either wipe out their opponents, plant/defuse the spike or a combination of both. A team achieves victory after winning 13 rounds before the opposing team.</p>

        <p>Players start off with 800 credits in the initial round dubbed the “pistol round” as an introduction to the match. These initial rounds only happen twice per match, once every 13 rounds when sides switch. Over the course of the match, players will earn credits depending on their performance such as kills, plants/defuses and round wins/losses.</p>
        <p>Rounds come to an end depending on certain objectives that each team has. Attackers can only win in two ways, either by planting and detonating the Spike or by eliminating the entire defending team. On the flip side, Defenders can win in one of three ways instead. Like the Attackers, they can win by wiping out the entire enemy team or defusing the Spike after it has been planted. The third method of victory can be achieved by running out the round timer of 100 seconds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you're coming to Valorant from any other shooter, you’ll easily recognize the different types of weapons as well as how much power they’ll have in comparison to other categories of guns. Valorant has divided their guns into 6 types: sidearms, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, heavy machine guns and shotguns.</p>
